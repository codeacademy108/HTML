<!-- Description list example 
In HTML text fundamentals, we walked through how to mark up basic lists in HTML, and we mentioned the third type of list you'll occasionally come across â€” description lists. The purpose of these lists is to mark up a set of items and their associated descriptions, such as terms and definitions, or questions and answers. Let's look at an example of a set of terms and definitions:-->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Description list example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <dl>
      <dt>soliloquy</dt>
      <dd>
        In drama, where a character speaks to themselves, representing their
        inner thoughts or feelings and in the process relaying them to the
        audience (but not to other characters.)
      </dd>
      <dt>monologue</dt>
      <dd>
        In drama, where a character speaks their thoughts out loud to share them
        with the audience and any other characters present.
      </dd>
      <dt>aside</dt>
      <dd>
        In drama, where a character shares a comment only with the audience for
        humorous or dramatic effect. This is usually a feeling, thought, or
        piece of additional background information.
