    <!-- What We Learn -->

    <!-- Structured content makes the reading experience easier and more enjoyable.
     In HTML, each paragraph has to be wrapped in a <p> element, like so: -->

    <p>I am a paragraph, oh yes I am.</p>

    <h1>I am the title of the story.</h1>

    <!-- There are six heading elements: h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6. Each element represents a different level of content in the document; <h1> represents the main heading, <h2> represents subheadings, <h3> represents sub-subheadings, and so on. -->

      Several more hours had passed, when all of a sudden the specter sat bolt
      upright and exclaimed, "Please have mercy on my soul!"

    <!-- Preferably, you should use a single <h1> per page—this is the top level heading, and all others sit below this in the hierarchy.
    Make sure you use the headings in the correct order in the hierarchy. Don't use <h3> elements to represent subheadings, followed by <h2> elements to represent sub-subheadings—that doesn't make sense and will lead to weird results. 
    Of the six heading levels available, you should aim to use no more than three per page, unless you feel it is necessary. Documents with many levels (for example, a deep heading hierarchy) become unwieldy and difficult to navigate. On such occasions, it is advisable to spread the content over multiple pages if possible. -->
